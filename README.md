# neural-net-digits
A barebones neural network lib built from scratch.
The library is used to train a neural network that can identify handwritten digits.
It is trained on the standard MNIST dataset.

This project comes with notes for those interested in the theory and mathematics.
It is completely original, so I'd appreciate crediting me if you wish to share it :)
